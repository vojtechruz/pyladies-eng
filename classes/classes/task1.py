# TASK: We already know how to work with kittens, lets now create a class for Cat.

# 1. It can meow using meow() method
# 2. When we create a new cat, it has 9 lives
# 3. Cat can indicate whether it is dead (0 lives) or alive using is_alive() method which returns boolean
# 4. Cat has method take_life() which reduces its life count by 1. Cat cannot have less than 0 lives.
# 5. It has eat() method which takes 1 input - string representing food to be eaten
#    when the food is 'fish' it will heal one life (if not dead and not at full 9 lives)
